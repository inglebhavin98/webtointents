For example, you could have 30% coinsurance for a filling. If the network cost of the filling is $100, you would pay $30 of that.

            "answer": "It depends. There is typically no waiting period for preventive services once you become covered. This means as soon as your dental insurance starts, you’ll be able to use the preventive care benefits. Some plans have no waiting period for all types of care. Other plans may have a waiting period of 4 to 12 months for basic and major services."
